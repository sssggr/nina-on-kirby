    Your company has grown, but your
    structures are lagging behind? I help
    you develop clear roles and processes
    that fit your organization – without
    bureaucracy that constrains you. So
    teams can work autonomously and you
    finally have time for strategic
    priorities again.

  offertext: "When coordination becomes sluggish and conflicts simmer beneath the surface, there's often a lack of clarity in roles and decision-making processes. I help teams move from friction to flow – with concrete guidelines and routines that work in daily practice."

    Working with Nina Siessegger gave me
    real clarity on my role as a team lead.
    I left every session with new energy and
    impulses that I was able to implement as
    many improvements in my day-to-day work.
    I’d absolutely choose leadership
    coaching with Nina again.

    Sustainable change instead of a
    short-term solution
  testimonial_text: "What I found particularly helpful about the coaching were the tools that I could use in my day-to-day work. It wasn't just about discussing current problems, but I was also given tools that I can use to tackle future challenges independently. This helped me to change my perspective and develop my leadership skills in the long term."
