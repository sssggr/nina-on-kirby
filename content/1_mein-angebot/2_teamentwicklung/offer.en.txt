This shows up especially in growing organizations: there's a lot to do, many things happen simultaneously, but there's a lack of direction, clarity in roles, and shared responsibility for what needs to be created."},"id":"0edc1e68-00e9-41db-a916-a65923f58924","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":{"subheading":"Maybe you recognize your team here?"},"id":"b09199ec-f411-4010-8e29-2de804be5bdb","isHidden":false,"type":"subheading"},{"content":{"list":"<ul><li>Your team was newly formed or has grown significantly</li><li>Collaboration is sluggish, there's a lack of trust or clarity</li><li>Roles and decision-making pathways are unclear</li><li>Conflicts are simmering under the surface but aren't being addressed productively</li><li>Your team doesn't really work independently, a lot still falls on you as the leader</li></ul>","styleselect":""},"id":"0db1f26e-0bef-4527-b400-9b52d4cfdf92","isHidden":false,"type":"list"},{"content":{"subheading":"How it could be instead"},"id":"d38235be-d8de-4d59-86f0-b6c0e738e5a9","isHidden":false,"type":"subheading"},{"content":{"list":"<ul><li>Your team takes ownership and is fully in flow</li><li>Everyone knows who does what and is responsible for what</li><li>It's clear who makes which decisions and what you decide together</li><li>You notice tensions early and address them</li><li>Leadership is relieved and gains freedom for strategic topics</li></ul>","styleselect":""},"id":"f67d9cda-a128-4292-8a56-6397c5d5285f","isHidden":false,"type":"list"},{"content":{"subheading":"Hi, I'm Nina Siessegger"},"id":"3f3b73e1-9732-4eea-9955-7ed536726c19","isHidden":false,"type":"subheading"},{"content":{"portrait":["file://AVf5iUAAKCtjfKpi"],"text":"I was part of teams myself for many years, as an editor, developer, in cross-functional project groups, and as a tech lead. I know the dynamics when everything becomes more at once: requirements, people, tensions. I know what it feels like when conflicts simmer beneath the surface, important information only gets passed along through the grapevine, and no one really knows who's actually in charge."},"id":"2cfedc5f-412b-4cba-b68d-12ee44fe2b16","isHidden":false,"type":"portrait-text"},{"content":{"text":"Since 2020, I've been supporting teams in exactly these situations. I bring practical experience from the tech world, organizational development, and mediation. A combination that helps when things get unclear, uncomfortable, or simply stuck."},"id":"7e047b90-48c8-4372-8a41-89f825ac943c","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":{"subheading":"What this means for you"},"id":"0b7336ab-a9bc-4471-9265-16a13c4997ee","isHidden":false,"type":"subheading"},{"content":{"text":"I don't just know models, but the reality of daily team life. I quickly notice where things are grinding and support you in working through tensions productively. Instead of chasing symptoms, we find the right levers together. So you can communicate more clearly, share responsibility, and get back to working together effectively."},"id":"b98c47b5-5fe2-4138-9ad0-0fadfb3bb3ce","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":{"subheading":"How we work together"},"id":"7d62c8ed-2175-44a2-a79b-d6391c2b66c3","isHidden":false,"type":"subheading"},{"content":{"text":"I don't come with ready-made concepts, but work with what's going on with you and what actually helps. No standard process, no off-the-shelf method. Instead, we look together: What's currently in the way? What really helps you move forward? Of course, I also bring my experience, but it's important to me to look specifically at your context and your team. My toolbox is versatile: systemic, lean, agile, sociocratic – I have what fits you.\n\nWhen necessary, insights from Team Topologies or modern forms of team design also flow in. Especially when the problems don't just lie within the team itself, but at interfaces with other teams. And as a certified mediator, I also guide teams through difficult situations with clarity and sensitivity."},"id":"18126a2f-62be-4378-b00c-dc6aa27bea21","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":{"subheading":"How we approach this"},"id":"58d67bd8-e797-49c4-8560-2027cb2768b1","isHidden":false,"type":"subheading"},{"content":{"text":"The approach is modular and oriented to what your team specifically needs.
