It uses agile methods and enables teams to work independently in an agile way. Employees are involved throughout and consistently involved in all steps. This results in tailor-made and sustainable solutions that are supported by everyone and remain in place even after the coaching. The programme helps to improve the quality of work by optimizing working conditions and processes. This often leads to an increase in employee satisfaction and productivity. INQA coaching also promotes the innovative capacity of companies and helps to secure skilled workers through more attractive working conditions. The coaching measures, which are individually tailored to the specific needs of the company, ensure optimal support and sustainable improvements."},"id":"2178dde9-8de2-4356-ac52-a7914838d9e0","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":{"subsubheading":"Who is being sponsored?","styleselect":""},"id":"64f27874-2fce-4788-bc40-d7c3c0b0c98e","isHidden":false,"type":"subsubheading"},{"content":{"text":"The funding program is aimed at SMEs based in Germany that have been on the market for at least two years, have fewer than 250 employees and employ at least one full-time employee subject to social security contributions.

This process consists of three phases, each lasting around four weeks. Each phase starts with a planning workshop (approximately 4 hours) and ends with an evaluation workshop (approximately 1.5 hours). The lab team spends the time in between actually working on the chosen topic - mostly self-organized. Approximately two hours per week are planned for the work phase, which each team member should spend at least within their regular working hours, the lab team leader at least 4 hours per week.\n\n**Learning phase:** This phase serves to evaluate the experiences and results achieved.

It develops and tests design solutions. The person responsible for the lab team is the central point of contact for the INQA coach and steering committee and drives the process forward in the lab team.\n\nRecommended composition of the lab team: 3-6 experts from the relevant areas, but without management. If there is a middle management level in the company, this can participate in the lab team, but in the role of a technical expert, not as a manager.\n\nFurther information on the process and the funding priorities can be found in the (link: file://OfEx2ooKfs4Ffaie text: official flyer) and on the (link: https://www.inqa.de/DE/handeln/inqa-coaching/uebersicht.html text: INQA website)."},"id":"c6e820f1-a9a2-4cc3-a29c-3c173e8bd39f","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":{"subsubheading":"References & feedback","styleselect":""},"id":"b8bc560d-1f98-4b6b-9242-a397343345a6","isHidden":false,"type":"subsubheading"},{"content":{"quotetext":"As part of our INQA project at the Chocoversum, our aim was to select an employee communication app that would best suit our requirements in day-to-day operations.
