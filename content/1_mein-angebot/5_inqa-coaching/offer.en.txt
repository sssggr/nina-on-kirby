The lab team and steering committee are formed in this phase.\n\n**Innovation phase:** In this phase, the lab team begins its work. This process consists of three phases, each lasting around four weeks. Each phase starts with a planning workshop (approximately 4 hours) and ends with an evaluation workshop (approximately 1.5 hours). The lab team spends the time in between actually working on the chosen topic - mostly self-organized. Approximately two hours per week are planned for the work phase, which each team member should spend at least within their regular working hours, the lab team leader at least 4 hours per week.\n\n**Learning phase:** This phase serves to evaluate the experiences and results achieved. This takes place as part of an evaluation workshop."},"id":"2f38102e-49f7-438d-805e-0b027df59364","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":{"bigimage":["file://Yn1QhglycwfZYvbO"],"styleselect":"flex"},"id":"db517421-2f99-446a-8a81-a11267030dbb","isHidden":false,"type":"bigimage"},{"content":{"text":"INQA Coaching works with a role concept that provides for a steering committee, a lab team and a person responsible for the lab team.\n\nThe steering committee is made up of representatives of the management and employees, sets the central topics and evaluates the progress of the initiated change process.\n\nThe lab team is made up of employees from the relevant organizational units. It develops and tests design solutions. The person responsible for the lab team is the central point of contact for the INQA coach and steering committee and drives the process forward in the lab team.\n\nRecommended composition of the lab team: 3-6 experts from the relevant areas, but without management. If there is a middle management level in the company, this can participate in the lab team, but in the role of a technical expert, not as a manager.\n\nFurther information on the process and the funding priorities can be found in the (link: file://OfEx2ooKfs4Ffaie text: official flyer) and on the (link: https://www.inqa.de/DE/handeln/inqa-coaching/uebersicht.html text: INQA website)."},"id":"c6e820f1-a9a2-4cc3-a29c-3c173e8bd39f","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"}]
