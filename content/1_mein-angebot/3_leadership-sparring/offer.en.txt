In this way, I provide you with optimal support in finding, reflecting on and further developing your leadership role in the organization. This combination enables us to initiate profound insight processes as well as to develop and implement concrete solution strategies.\n\n**This is what characterizes our sparring:**"},"id":"12400318-a990-4bdc-8e78-d3f98fba0ff9","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":{"list":"<ul><li>Finding solutions together: We work together to develop concrete solutions for your leadership challenges.</li><li>Critical reflection: I constructively question your existing ideas and experiences in order to develop or consolidate them</li><li>Mix of methods: I use techniques from coaching, but also contribute my experience, my specialist knowledge and concrete suggestions for solutions.</li><li>Practical orientation: Together we examine the suitability of solutions for you and your company.</li><li>Intensive support: If necessary, we can discuss difficult situations at short notice and run through various scenarios.</li></ul>","styleselect":"offer"},"id":"5da1ae7d-1ffd-4e4c-a4be-89780379fc02","isHidden":false,"type":"list"},{"content":{"text":"**What we achieve together: **"},"id":"d323b648-4f10-4304-a636-12ea01ba551d","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":{"list":"<ul><li>Clarity and orientation: You gain clarity about your leadership role and your goals.</li><li>Skills development: You will further develop your leadership skills and strengthen your communication, conflict resolution and decision-making abilities.</li><li>Successful teamwork: You will learn what self-organized teams need to work together successfully and deliver excellent results.</li></ul>","styleselect":"offer"},"id":"f109755f-d093-4bc2-98f4-dbad412e2574","isHidden":false,"type":"list"},{"content":{"text":"**This is what our collaboration looks like**\n\nWe arrange a non-binding initial call.
