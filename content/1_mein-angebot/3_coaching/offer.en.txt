When it fits, insights from organizational development, team dynamics, or mediation flow in.\n\nAdditionally, I use the LINC Personality Profiler when needed – a well-founded tool that helps you better understand your strengths, motivations, and behavioral patterns, enabling you to lead more consciously, communicate more clearly, and collaborate more effectively with others."},"id":"d7becfd8-8983-44ab-b13f-97ee1185910a","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":{"subheading":"How we can work together"},"id":"fca1fadb-3cdd-434c-be0c-e175591601e0","isHidden":false,"type":"subheading"},{"content":{"text":"All coaching offerings start with a non-binding 30-minute getting-to-know-you conversation – free and easily bookable through my calendar.
