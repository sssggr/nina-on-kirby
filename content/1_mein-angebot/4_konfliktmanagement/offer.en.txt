The mood is bad and collaboration is difficult? Conflict costs time, energy, nerves and ultimately money, as it can affect collaboration to such an extent that productive progress is no longer possible.\n\nConflicts are unavoidable and are part and parcel of social interaction. Although they are usually not pleasant for those involved, they are often also an opportunity for change. The crucial question is therefore not whether conflicts occur, but how we deal with them.\n\nI am a certified mediator and support you in dealing with conflicts and strengthening your own conflict competence."},"id":"fa5b9977-c8f1-4562-b7fd-c799a3631dbf","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":{"subheading":"My services"},"id":"7345aa5b-5335-4627-a9b2-e23b4bc7b0a3","isHidden":false,"type":"subheading"},{"content":{"subsubheading":"Conflict mediation and moderation","styleselect":"offer"},"id":"96584464-5785-4808-85f7-7984ed61e7dc","isHidden":false,"type":"subsubheading"},{"content":{"text":"Sometimes conflicts have escalated to such an extent that they can no longer be resolved on their own.

It can be used in all situations where it is useful to resolve conflicts and maintain long-term relationships.

As a mediator, I ensure a structured process in which each party can present their views and discuss proposed solutions. During the process, the parties explore whether and on which points they can reach an agreement.","content":""},{"headline":"What is the result of mediation?","answer":"The mediation process is open-ended. The parties may come to an agreement and draw up a joint final agreement containing arrangements for the future. In some cases, no agreement can be reached. At the end of the process, there is always clarity as to whether and how to proceed.","content":""}]},"id":"f07f661e-724f-4ee9-aa04-db73fe7aecfb","isHidden":false,"type":"accordion"},{"content":{"subsubheading":"Workshops to strengthen conflict competence for teams and groups","styleselect":"offer"},"id":"26adab44-a438-4202-8e24-ed1280f4a2ca","isHidden":false,"type":"subsubheading"},{"content":{"text":"Would you like to actively address the topic of conflict as a team or group?
