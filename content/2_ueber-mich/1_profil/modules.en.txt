As an organizational consultant and coach with a tech background, I support start-ups and growing companies in building organizations where everyone knows what matters and is eager to take ownership. This takes pressure off you as a founding or leadership team and fosters a team that’s engaged and committed to staying with you."},"id":"fb4cdf56-51e4-47ef-ad4c-2d0e426051f0","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":{"subheading":"Does that sound familiar?"},"id":"99040a1f-f993-4f94-a603-3e8140830521","isHidden":false,"type":"subheading"},{"content":{"list":"<ul><li>Your company is growing – but structure and processes aren’t keeping up?</li><li>You're constantly in firefighting mode because everything still ends up on your desk?</li><li>New hires were supposed to ease the load – but instead, things feel even more complex?</li><li>No one’s really sure who’s doing what, and important tasks keep slipping through the cracks?</li><li>And at the same time, you're wondering: How can we create more structure without getting stuck in bureaucracy?</li></ul>","styleselect":""},"id":"8a4fcd2b-718b-4a38-bf4f-7cfd9fff09af","isHidden":false,"type":"list"},{"content":{"subheading":"To do great work, you need the right setup."},"id":"377a2c91-e2c8-48fa-988e-12726e6ed956","isHidden":false,"type":"subheading"},{"content":{"text":"I’ve experienced it myself—that feeling when everything happens at once: The team is growing, expectations are rising, everyone is busy, but nothing really feels structured. As a developer and tech lead, I was right in the middle of it: caught between decisions that weren’t being made, unclear roles, and the sense that we were working hard but not really moving forward.\n\nWhat was missing back then? Clear decision-making spaces, transparency about what really mattered at that moment, and a structure that gave us orientation—without slowing down our pace or compromising our culture.\n\nToday, I know: this is exactly what organizations need to grow in a healthy way. I help you create a framework where teams take ownership, real impact happens, and you as leaders gain back the space to shape and steer.\nNot with one-size-fits-all solutions, but with a clear eye for what truly makes a difference in your unique context."},"id":"97d8d7a7-818f-4e5a-9e37-af39b51af272","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":{"subheading":"Why me?

As a developer, tech lead, and consultant, I’ve seen a wide range of companies from the inside. I understand what it feels like when leadership is overwhelmed, decisions are stuck, no one knows who’s doing what, and the real priorities get lost.\n\nOver the past few years, I’ve worked closely with companies and leadership teams to help them create more structure, flow, and space for what really matters."},"id":"40e08f03-c026-405f-8c85-612c706f214a","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":{"subsubheading":"This is what one of my clients shared","styleselect":""},"id":"b5cf7193-81c1-471a-a787-6cf7c3b92308","isHidden":false,"type":"subsubheading"},{"content":{"quotetext":"Nina has been supporting us for some time now as a sparring partner for organizational development and leadership.

I'm a trained organizational designer, facilitator, and coach—and as a certified mediator, I’m also well prepared to navigate challenging situations.\n\nToday’s organizations are unthinkable without technology and digitalization. I’ve been working in tech for over 10 years, and in the digital space for more than 20. With me, there are no “lost in translation” moments: I understand both the technical and the human side. That saves time, reduces misunderstandings, and builds trust—especially at the interfaces between tech, product, HR, and leadership."},"id":"b692ea22-d905-4c71-b396-cb53c7e4e830","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":{"subheading":"How I Work"},"id":"ac0b5819-f494-4a80-95be-901c9caaf613","isHidden":false,"type":"subheading"},{"content":{"text":"I don’t work with off-the-shelf concepts. Instead, we take a close look together: Where are things really getting stuck? What needs to change so that collaboration, ownership, and outcomes truly improve?\n\nWhether it’s organizational consulting or team development, I follow a proven approach: We start with clarifying the assignment—what’s on your mind? Where’s the pressure point? What do you want to achieve? Next, we dive deeper: What’s really going on beneath the surface? From there, we can set priorities and co-create solutions.\n\nAnd along the way, we keep checking in: Where are we now? Are we still on the right track? Is the idea or solution actually working in your day-to-day?"},"id":"2f9fb191-ad7a-41a7-a3d5-053567f26d21","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":[],"id":"d91a9aa0-b7fe-48b0-8dd5-0597642b1612","isHidden":false,"type":"process"},{"content":{"subheading":"My Compass"},"id":"cd333024-a253-4ed4-b71d-e082a02bb5ee","isHidden":false,"type":"subheading"},{"content":{"text":"**Focused** – We concentrate on what’s really getting in the way.\n**Participatory ** – We include the relevant perspectives so that solutions are co-created and broadly supported.\n**Iterative** – Things don’t have to be perfect from the start.

For the past 25 years, I’ve called Hamburg home. I love the city and its way of life—whenever I need a break, I head to the Elbe river for a walk.\n\nMovement is important to me. For a few years now, I can't imagine life without exercise—something I definitely wouldn’t have predicted 20 years ago. Functional training, yoga, and, for the past two years, Muay Thai (Thai boxing) have become a great way for me to recharge—and honestly, I really enjoy it.\n\nAnd since life isn’t all about training, good food matters too. I love cooking, have almost every Ottolenghi cookbook on my shelf, and a soft spot for Southeast Asian cuisine."},"id":"5bd7c566-774e-495e-a60a-e7034d032695","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":{"subheading":"Networks and Collaborations"},"id":"59c84e22-1b9d-45bc-a5c4-35739950815b","isHidden":false,"type":"subheading"},{"content":{"list":"<ul><li>Consultant, coach, and trainer within the Lucas Consulting Team network</li><li>Team Topologies Advocate</li><li>Authorized process consultant in the INQA Coaching program</li><li>Volunteer mentor with MentorMe</li></ul>","styleselect":""},"id":"801adcdc-11e6-4172-bf9b-1a7e7fe1395d","isHidden":false,"type":"list"},{"content":{"subheading":"Publications"},"id":"b28314d9-e2ae-415a-b831-f250633f4a5b","isHidden":false,"type":"subheading"},{"content":{"text":"(link: https://dpunkt.de/produkt/git-kurz-gut-2/ text: Git – kurz & gut)\nAn introduction to the version control system Git, published by O'Reilly in 2022 and 2024 (German)\n\n(link: https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html text: On Pair Programming)\nIn this article my co-author (link: https://birgitta.info/ text: Birgitta Böckeler) and I explore pair programming.
