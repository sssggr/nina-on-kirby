This question arises sooner or later in every growing software company. In many organizations, teams form the foundation upon which companies build their entire organizational design. In this case study, I explain how we chose a participatory approach for Pirate Ship to master exactly this challenge.\n\nTogether with  (link: https://susannekaiser.net/ text: Susanne Kaiser), the German founders of (link: https://pirateship.tech/ text: Pirate Ship), and the development teams, we put the Architecture for Flow approach, developed by Susanne, into practice and guided a reorganization process that actively involved the teams in all decisions.\n\nWhat to expect from this case study:\n\n* How we used Architecture for Flow as a holistic approach for team reorganization\n* Which workshops and formats proved successful in the participatory redesign of teams\n* How we worked with self-selection and consent-based decision making\n* What learnings can be derived for similar reorganization processes"},"id":"5fd0d391-151b-48ab-a663-6a3321d02663","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":{"subheading":"The Initial Situation at Pirate Ship"},"id":"7fcc55d9-6212-4954-974e-d93a40cbd2fd","isHidden":false,"type":"subheading"},{"content":{"text":"Pirate Ship is a company founded in 2014 that offers cloud-based shipping software for small and medium-sized businesses, making shipping as easy and affordable as possible for them. What makes it special: The software is free to use, with the business model based on partnerships with shipping service providers.\n\nThe company operates from two locations: the headquarters with customer support, marketing, finance, and partner management is in the USA. Software development is based in Hamburg, Germany, where around 30 developers are now employed.\n\nThe major growth spurt began in 2021. Until then, the Hamburg development department had worked as a single team — with the characteristic spirit of a startup crew: little structure, lots of freedom, everyone working on everything. When the team was split and an infrastructure team was additionally created in 2022, this meant a significant cultural change, especially for the \"original crew.\" But the previous team setup had reached its limits.\n\nIn 2023, it became apparent that further growth was imminent. The existing teams were reaching their limits - both in terms of the size of their domains and workload. The two German founders & managing directors wanted to take a different approach this time: The new team structure should be sustainable and flexible to enable future growth. I accompany the German organization and its managing directors as a consultant and sparring partner and recommended collaboration with Susanne Kaiser as an expert in Team Topologies, Domain Driven Design, and Wardley Mapping and her Architecture for Flow approach derived from these methods."},"id":"f24e6e72-4b1d-4d70-8fbe-377d3e63dcfa","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":{"subsubheading":"The Specific Challenges","styleselect":""},"id":"e742b6c7-598b-4a8c-97cf-c00029af6d4e","isHidden":false,"type":"subsubheading"},{"content":{"text":"In 2023, there were three feature teams and one infrastructure team. At the center was a PHP monolith that had grown over the years. The teams were struggling with several challenges:\n\n* Overload: The teams were at their capacity limit\n* Domains too large: The teams had to handle too many different tasks, which led to knowledge silos and made knowledge exchange difficult\n* Unclear ownership: Responsibilities for components used across teams were often unclear or historically tied to individuals\n* Development bottlenecks: These made further team growth necessary\n\nWhile Pirate Ship was already working with vertically sliced, cross-functional teams, the first team divisions had occurred without in-depth analysis of the domain. This time it was to be different: The goal was not only to integrate ten more developers but above all to create a sustainable team structure. Through a thorough analysis of the domain, teams should be created that can deliver value independently and effectively despite the complex monolith. Limiting teams to a maximum of seven people was intended to enable close collaboration and prevent the emergence of new knowledge silos.\n\nAn important context for our approach: Pirate Ship maintains a very participatory culture. The teams work in an agile manner and are responsible for their own work processes. They work with quarterly goals, and besides the teams, there are self-managed working groups for areas such as recruiting, onboarding, and DevOps."},"id":"93803f22-ff09-4f48-8a3c-7576a082aa69","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":{"subheading":"Architecture for Flow: A Holistic Approach for Adaptive Systems"},"id":"24d8ee02-62a4-4719-a1fe-ea7e1d719a40","isHidden":false,"type":"subheading"},{"content":{"text":"In a world of rapid changes and growing uncertainties, organizations must continuously adapt to remain competitive.

Central to this is the close collaboration between domain experts and development teams to develop a common language and understanding.\nDDD distinguishes three types of domains:\n\n1. **Core Domain:** The area that provides the essential competitive advantage. At Pirate Ship, this is, for example, intelligent shipping processing. This domain should be developed internally.\n2. **Supporting Subdomains:** Areas that support the core business but do not offer a direct competitive advantage. For example, the evaluation of shipping statistics. These can be covered by existing solutions or developed internally with less effort.\n3. **Generic Subdomains:** Standard functions that every company needs, such as user authentication. Here, one should usually rely on existing solutions.\n\nAnother important concept is Bounded Contexts: They define clear boundaries within which a specific domain model applies. This not only helps with technical structuring, these bounded contexts are also excellent for identifying team boundaries. In practice, this leads to clearer responsibilities and reduced complexity."},"id":"42ae0746-413c-4d49-8731-c29be8a4b79f","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":{"bigimage":["file://oiQXvMoM2RVi6wdx"],"styleselect":"flex"},"id":"3c038e05-3692-4fc4-9226-20fe1e4ff94a","isHidden":false,"type":"bigimage"},{"content":{"text":"A lightweight format for exploring domains and identifying bounded contexts is the EventStorming workshop method.

The approach aims to enable fast and sustainable value creation by designing teams and their interactions in such a way that they can focus on their core tasks. For this, the framework defines four team types and three interaction modes that together enable an adaptive organization in which teams can deliver value independently of each other.\n\nThe four basic team types are:\n\n1. **Stream-aligned Teams:** These teams are the heart of the organization. They are aligned to a continuous stream of work and end-to-end responsible for specific business functions.\n2. **Platform Teams: **They provide internal platforms as self-service products that can be used by stream-aligned teams. This reduces dependencies and accelerates development.\n3. **Enabling Teams:** These teams act as internal consulting units and help other teams build new capabilities. They are particularly important in phases of change.\n4. **Complicated-Subsystem Teams:** They take care of specialized components that require special expertise.\n\nFor these teams to work together effectively, Team Topologies defines three central interaction modes:\n\n* **Collaboration:** Close, time-limited collaboration, ideal for innovation and exploration\n* **X-as-a-Service:** One team uses the services of another team\n* **Facilitation:** Active support in building new capabilities"},"id":"9cb50e18-f7f6-42eb-9569-c399b7f632b9","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":{"bigimage":["file://CV1C9pXVT3khggVo"],"styleselect":"flex"},"id":"4d388101-a43b-4f57-adf7-5b244c1033bd","isHidden":false,"type":"bigimage"},{"content":{"text":"With this methodological foundation, we set out to implement it practically at Pirate Ship.

In EventStorming, teams jointly visualize their business processes by arranging all domain events (important business events) on a large wall or digital board. At Pirate Ship, Susanne worked intensively with Miro boards as the workshops were predominantly held remotely.\n\nThe result of this phase was not yet a final structure, but rather a kaleidoscope of different perspectives: Each team had identified several options for possible bounded contexts and their grouping.

The baseline was clear:\n\n* The teams had already grown beyond their optimal size\n* The workload had reached critical levels\n* The product strategy foresaw further growth in these areas\n\nFor the cell division workshops, we developed a blueprint that proved to be a very effective basis for the 2-day workshops. One team workshop was completely remote, the other team met on site.\n\n**1. Hopes & Fears**\n\n* Openly addressing and documenting hopes and fears\n* Creates psychological safety for the change process\n\n**2. Domain Division**\n\n* Presentation of an initial proposal by the founder & CTO – based on the bounded contexts developed in Phase 1 and the patterns emerging from them\n* Presentation of the product strategy for the area. This helped to distribute the workload of the identified bounded contexts evenly between two teams.\n* Discussion and adjustment of the proposal with consent decision making\n\n**3.

Next Steps**\n\n* Definition of concrete next steps\n* Creation of a rough timeline\n\nAn interesting aspect: The two teams chose different timeframes for their cell division.

While we had created clear responsibilities for domain-specific components, there were still ambiguities with the Shared Components.\n\n####The Initial Situation\nSeveral components are used by different teams, for example:\n\n* Frontend components\n* Database adapters\n* Monitoring solutions\n* ...\n\nThe responsibilities for these components had grown historically and were often tied to individuals. This led to several problems:\n\n* Unclear responsibilities\n* Dependencies between teams\n* Delays in changes\n* Knowledge lies with individual developers\n\n####The Path to the Platform Team\nWith the Platform Teams, we adopted a concept from Team Topologies. Platform Teams have a special role: They provide services to other teams as self-service platforms. This reduces dependencies and accelerates development.\n\nFor the conception of the Platform Team, Susanne and I planned another workshop.\n\n**Preparation:**\n\n* Asynchronous inventory of all shared components\n* Collection of current responsibilities\n* Open invitation to all interested parties (In the end, almost 20 participants were there)\n\n**1. Hopes & Fears**\n\n* Expectations and concerns regarding the establishment of a Platform Team\n\n**2. Status Quo Analysis**\n\n* Mapping of current pain points\n* Inventory of shared components\n* Identification of dependencies\n\n**3.

Team Design**\n\n* Development of different team constellations\n* Discussion of the options\n* Consent-based decision\n\n**5. Transition Planning**\n\n* How do we get there?\n* What questions need to be clarified next (e.g., number of new hires)?\n\nWhere necessary, there were brief recaps on User Value, Value Chain & Wardley Mapping in the workshop - the initial workshops of the teams on these topics had already taken place several months earlier.\n\n**Results and Next Steps**\n\nThe workshop led to concrete results:\n\n* Vision for the first iteration of the Platform Team\n* Prioritized list of Platform Services\n* Rough implementation plan\n\nParticularly valuable was the joint development of the solution: All participants could contribute their perspectives and participate in the design. This created broad acceptance for the new Platform Team.\n\nThe actual establishment of the Platform Team is still ongoing at the time of publication of this article. An important aspect: This is not a completed process, but the beginning of a continuous evolution. The Platform Team will evolve based on the needs of the stream-aligned teams and the learnings from practice."},"id":"c80802f1-7553-4c9b-80e7-967ad8c076fe","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":{"bigimage":["file://xiGCVj8UR7X2p7Ai"],"styleselect":"flex"},"id":"4544a874-30ab-4e9e-9c38-46fdf5e54f66","isHidden":false,"type":"bigimage"},{"content":{"subheading":"Conclusion: Central Learnings from the Reorganization Process"},"id":"47a08666-e260-4ed1-9967-a58146775f3a","isHidden":false,"type":"subheading"},{"content":{"text":"After several years of experience with team reorganizations - both as a team member, tech lead, and as a consultant—several success factors have become particularly evident from my perspective at Pirate Ship:"},"id":"485d971b-dfb3-47f4-b06a-0aee515e3f09","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":{"subsubheading":"Deep Domain Understanding is the Key","styleselect":""},"id":"dd033cec-bdab-4dd7-a7f6-cf49ee87adc0","isHidden":false,"type":"subsubheading"},{"content":{"text":"A fundamental understanding of the domain is the most important factor for a successful reorganization.
