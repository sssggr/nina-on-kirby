Teasertext: Modern, self-organized teams are expected to make decisions independently. The idea: decisions should be made close to the market, close to the customer. But what does this mean in practice? Who decides exactly what? When and how? And ultimately, who is accountable for the outcomes?

Whoever already has influence, obviously. This can damage trust and collaboration long-term.\n\nClarity doesn't mean micromanaging everything. It's about shared understanding. About roles, expectations, and decision logic.\n\nClear decision processes strengthen ownership in the team. They take pressure off leadership. And they make implementation faster.
