A team isn't automatically a team just because two people are working on something.\n\nA real team has a common goal, needs to coordinate, and depends on each other to achieve that goal.\n\nAs a practical rule of thumb: Three people is the minimum for real team behavior to emerge. Below that, you're often more of a duo with coordination needs, which can be perfectly fine in many cases. But then you don't need team development—you might need clear coordination and agreements instead."},"id":"7dcfc85a-2694-4877-8d72-b1b81c23a0c9","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":{"subheading":"And What Does Practice Show?"},"id":"9218ffcd-06eb-4463-9655-ef328d65f3fc","isHidden":false,"type":"subheading"},{"content":{"text":"In my experience, teams with up to 7 people usually work very well; when there are more, it can become unwieldy.\nWhat I often observe then:"},"id":"568a7912-7094-466b-9d6a-ba5eb1ea7c59","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":{"list":"<ul><li>Coordination effort increases.</li><li>Teams work on too many topics in parallel.</li><li>Cognitive load increases—constantly juggling too many topics in your head.</li><li>Decisions drag on or get lost.</li><li>Focus is lost.</li></ul>","styleselect":""},"id":"6450dcaa-4a8e-4353-a498-735b38b94d17","isHidden":false,"type":"list"},{"content":{"text":"When several team members feel like they're losing track despite coordination meetings, no longer know what others are working on, can't see a common goal anymore—that's often a clearer indicator than any study."},"id":"356affb7-d1b4-4a99-a420-518b7cd44ec5","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":{"subheading":"When Should You Split or Restructure a Team?"},"id":"a2215aae-0c59-43b1-b1be-17846bc4e373","isHidden":false,"type":"subheading"},{"content":{"text":"When a team grows, there are often ideas like: \"We need a new meeting.\" Sometimes also: \"We need a new role\" or \"We can solve this with tool XY.\" All of this can help address coordination effort, but rarely solves the actual problem.\n\nWhat sometimes works when a real split isn't possible—e.g., because the company doesn't allow new teams: Working in sub-teams.\n\nThis means: A team of ten people internally divides into smaller groups, each focused on one topic. This creates more focus, less coordination effort—and the team still formally remains intact."},"id":"c3dd5330-dbfc-400b-a93a-c6dd2d1f84e6","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":{"subheading":"What If This Is Your First Team Split?"},"id":"30a0ee4d-0c10-4b66-826c-6a1399f5453a","isHidden":false,"type":"subheading"},{"content":{"text":"Maybe you've been working as one team so far, everyone does everything somehow. Decisions are made together, tasks are sometimes distributed spontaneously. The thought of splitting up feels unfamiliar at first. Almost like a break. What if the connection is lost?\nEspecially in young companies, I often observe uncertainty at this point and the reflex to leave everything as it is for now. Yet a team split can achieve exactly the opposite: It strengthens the connection—because clarity creates trust and smaller units facilitate real collaboration.\n\nSmaller teams provide relief. They reduce cognitive load, reduce coordination effort, and create more focus. A prerequisite for this is also that it's clear:\n* Who is responsible for what\n* How the interfaces work\n* And where decisions are made\n\nThe design of tasks also plays an important role. Ideally, teams can deliver value independently of each other, with few dependencies—close to the market and users.\n\nIn one project, we used the image of cell division for this: Knowledge, attitude, and culture of the original team are consciously carried forward and continue to develop in the new units.\n\nThe crucial question isn't just: What do we lose through a split? But also: What do we gain? Discussing these questions with the team from the beginning and returning to them repeatedly helps with letting go and creates real momentum toward the new."},"id":"4e4857b3-9454-4866-bcc6-4b71f372839a","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":{"subheading":"What If You Have Multiple Teams—But the Structure Is Stuck?"},"id":"4b1d0082-3d78-40d6-bd2b-e39328f11b40","isHidden":false,"type":"subheading"},{"content":{"text":"Sometimes it's not a single team that's the problem, but the overall structure. Multiple teams work alongside each other, but not well coordinated with each other. Typical signs of this:\n\n* There are thematic overlaps without clear coordination.\n* Teams block each other because they're too dependent on one another.\n* Responsibility gets stuck with individuals or is so diffuse that nobody is responsible.\n* Handoffs lead to friction losses instead of smooth collaboration.\n\nIn such situations, off-the-shelf reorganization doesn't help. It's more useful to take a close look at the business domain and work flows. This works best together with those who experience them daily and know their business domain.\n\nCollaborative methods like (link: https://www.eventstorming.com/ text: Event Storming), (link: https://userneedsmapping.com/ text: User Needs Mapping), or (link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping text: Value Stream Mapping) help develop a shared picture. These formats help make dependencies, responsibilities, and interfaces visible. Wardley Mapping can also be useful as a supplement—for example, when it comes to technological decisions, make-or-buy, or platform architecture.\n\nOnly then is it worth looking at the appropriate team design. For example, with (link: https://teamtopologies.com/ text: Team Topologies) or (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6T78XMxbuY&t=3s text: dynamic re-teaming approaches) that help create structures that facilitate collaboration and enable flow."},"id":"47459547-3d28-49d6-8412-c404809836f9","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":{"subheading":"Mini-Check: Is Your Team Still Set Up Right?"},"id":"ab4356f4-06c3-4c59-8fbc-534c1f1931f3","isHidden":false,"type":"subheading"},{"content":{"text":"Answer the following questions for your team:\n\n* Are there tasks that regularly get left undone because nobody feels responsible?\n* Do you know what others are currently working on?\n* Do you often feel like you're taking on things that should really belong elsewhere?\n* Are you highly dependent on other teams?\n* Do you lack focus because everything is equally important and you don't know what to tackle first?\n* Are you constantly working on multiple topics in parallel?\n* Do certain topics always get stuck with the same people?\n\nIf you nodded internally to several questions, this might be the right moment to look at your team structure and size."},"id":"c468e58c-2b66-4b55-bfbd-ee5681dfcd45","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":{"headline":"Want to eliminate friction?
