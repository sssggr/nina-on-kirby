During my studies of history, politics and Eastern European studies, I ended up in the online media sector, where I worked for almost 10 years in various roles - most recently as an online editor at NDR.\n\nI have been working in agile contexts since 2014 - as a software developer, tech lead, agile coach, consultant, author and team coach. Initially for various start-ups, then as a developer and consultant at the technology consultancy ThoughtWorks. I have been self-employed since 2019. Over the years, I have gained experience in various companies and organizations, from small start-ups to large corporations, working in and with international and multicultural teams.\n\nSince 2020, I have been focusing more and more on supporting organizations and teams in their further development and in change processes."},"id":"fb4cdf56-51e4-47ef-ad4c-2d0e426051f0","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":{"subheading":"Education and training"},"id":"40ca24a8-d553-4631-8860-a3986522b118","isHidden":false,"type":"subheading"},{"content":{"list":"<ul><li>Certified mediator according to the Mediation Act (IMK/EHV)</li><li>Systemic team coaching (die coachingakademie)</li><li>Sociocracy 3.0 Practitioner Level 1</li><li>Agile cultural change &amp; organizational development (Teamworks)</li><li>Authorized process consultant in the INQA-Coaching program</li><li>Certified ScrumMaster®</li><li>Various further training courses (online moderation, visualization, management of remote teams, liberating structures, design thinking)</li></ul>","styleselect":""},"id":"8045dbdc-fecc-43a4-a990-27ad51ddc49a","isHidden":false,"type":"list"},{"content":{"subheading":"How I work"},"id":"cbfa35fd-03ae-4934-b368-74b83abb1048","isHidden":false,"type":"subheading"},{"content":{"text":"My approach is systemic and appreciative. It is important to me to strengthen, activate and utilize existing resources. Solutions that have a lasting effect are not introduced from outside, but are developed by those involved themselves.\n\nI am pragmatic and work in a solution-oriented way. Small, continuous steps that are easy to implement in everyday life enable incremental change and continuous learning. I therefore particularly value the principle of continuous improvement, especially when dealing with complex situations.\n\nIt is important to me to create a space where everyone involved can contribute their views and expertise. I firmly believe that the diversity of perspectives and the cooperation of all those involved lead to creative and effective solutions.\n\nIn my work, I like to combine systemic and agile approaches. The systemic approach takes into account the interrelationships and interactions within the system, while agile methods promote flexibility and adaptability."},"id":"d70a08c9-5d45-43fb-867c-4e7033b1ec3b","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"}]
