My approach? Pragmatic, solution-oriented and always with an eye on the big picture.\n\n**\nMy journey: Diverse perspectives for holistic solutions\n**\nAt the intersection of technology and journalism, I experienced the digitalization of journalistic offerings in the online media sector. As a software developer in startups, I encountered firsthand the challenges of fast-growing teams and how to work innovatively and agilely with limited resources. At ThoughtWorks, a leading technology consultancy, I not only deepened my understanding of agile methods, but also successfully implemented them in enterprise environments.\n\nSince 2020, I have been bringing all these experiences together as an independent organizational consultant and team coach, supporting companies and teams in addressing their specific challenges."},"id":"fb4cdf56-51e4-47ef-ad4c-2d0e426051f0","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":{"subheading":"My career"},"id":"99040a1f-f993-4f94-a603-3e8140830521","isHidden":false,"type":"subheading"},{"content":{"list":"<ul><li>Born in 1980, living in Hamburg since 2001</li><li>MA in History, Politics and Eastern European Studies</li><li>Nearly a decade of experience in online media</li><li>Working in agile environments since 2014, primarily in tech:<ul><li>Software developer in various start-ups</li><li>Developer, consultant and tech lead at the global technology consultancy ThoughtWorks</li><li>Freelance software developer</li></ul></li><li>Working as Independent Organizational Consultant and Team Developer since 2020</li></ul>","styleselect":""},"id":"084be9c3-8429-4a4a-ad62-b782bf07a95a","isHidden":false,"type":"list"},{"content":{"subheading":"Education and training"},"id":"40ca24a8-d553-4631-8860-a3986522b118","isHidden":false,"type":"subheading"},{"content":{"list":"<ul><li>Since 10/2024: Trigon Diploma Program for Coaching</li><li>Organizational designer TeamworksPlus®</li><li>Mediation und Facilitation (IMK/EHV), certified mediator according to the German Mediation Act </li><li>Systemic team coaching (die coachingakademie)</li><li>Sociocracy 3.0 Practitioner Level 1</li><li>Authorized process consultant in the INQA-Coaching program</li><li>Certified ScrumMaster®</li><li>Various further trainings (online moderation, visualization, management of remote teams, liberating structures, design thinking)</li></ul>","styleselect":""},"id":"8045dbdc-fecc-43a4-a990-27ad51ddc49a","isHidden":false,"type":"list"},{"content":{"subheading":"How I work"},"id":"cbfa35fd-03ae-4934-b368-74b83abb1048","isHidden":false,"type":"subheading"},{"content":{"text":"My approach is characterized by a systemic and appreciative attitude.

The diversity of perspectives leads to creative and effective solutions.\n\n**Continuous improvement and learning:** I focus on gradual development with practical impulses for change. Small, steady improvements enable incremental change and sustainable learning - particularly valuable in complex situations. \n\n**Combining systemic and agile approaches:** I like to combine systemic and agile approaches in my work. The systemic approach takes into account the interrelationships and interactions within the system, while agile methods promote flexibility and adaptability.\n\nThis holistic approach makes it possible to develop tailor-made solutions that not only work in the short term, but also contribute to the long-term success and further development of organizations and teams."},"id":"435fde67-8690-4b4f-85b1-3bb1f48029f4","isHidden":false,"type":"bodytext"},{"content":{"subheading":"Publications"},"id":"b28314d9-e2ae-415a-b831-f250633f4a5b","isHidden":false,"type":"subheading"},{"content":{"text":"(link: https://dpunkt.de/produkt/git-kurz-gut-2/ text: Git – kurz & gut)\nAn introduction to the version control system Git, published by O'Reilly in 2022 and 2024 (German)\n\n(link: https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html text: On Pair Programming)\nIn this article my co-author (link: https://birgitta.info/ text: Birgitta Böckeler) and I explore pair programming.
